### DOS Attack 拒绝服务攻击

A DOS attack (where DOS stands for Denial Of Service) is an attack where the resources of a computer system are deliberately exhausted by the attacker so that the system is no longer able to provide service to the clients. In this specific case of the attack demonstrated by Scott Crosby, the attack was possible flooding the target system with a lot of data whose hash collide, making the target system use a lot more of computing power to resolve the collisions.
