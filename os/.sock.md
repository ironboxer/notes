### what's .sock file



>A socket file doesnt actually contain data, it transports it.. It is a special, unusual type of file created with special system calls/commands. It is not an ordinary file.
>
>It is like a pipe the server and the clients can use to connect and exchange requests and data. Also, it is only used locally. Its significance is merely as an agreed rendezvous location in the filesystem.
>
>Creating a plain old file and putting it in that location may actually interfere with the server creating it... and thereby prevent local clients from connecting to the server.
>
>My recommendation is to remove any file you put in the location. The special socket file is created by the server.
